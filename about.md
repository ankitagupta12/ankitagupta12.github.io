I am a software engineer currently working at Stripe.

I spend most of my time working on web development, systems architecture, and product engineering. I am particularly interested in digging under the surface of abstractions that I interact with to gain a better understanding of the systems that I work on. I am using this blog to journal my learnings about topics that pique my curiosity.

Thanks for reading!
